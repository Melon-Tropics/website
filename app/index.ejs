    <h2>Use <a href="http://semver.org">SemVer</a>. We‚Äôll have your back.</h2>
    <p>The npm ecosystem with around half a million modules is a great foundation to build your software on, and Greenkeeper makes it more reliable. You‚Äôll spend less time with dull chores, and more time with the fun parts of software development.</p>
    <p>Greenkeeper is a friendly bot that tells you when updates to your dependencies break your software. It automatically detects the latest working version and you can then choose to either immediately fix the issue or just pin the dependency so you can get back to it once you have the time. Either way: no more broken software.</p>

    <h2>Automated dependency management</h2>
    <p>You <em>could</em> manually track updates of your dependencies and test whether things still work. This takes <em>a lot of time</em> however and it‚Äôs rarely ever done. So most of the time, <strong>your software is in a Schr√∂dinger state of being potentially broken</strong>, and you have no idea until you (or your users) run <code>npm install</code> and try it out.</p>
    <p>Greenkeeper <strong>takes away these chores</strong> of dependency management: For each update to any of your dependencies, our bot immediately runs <code>npm install</code> and <code>npm test</code>. There is no more doubt about the state of your software, you‚Äôll always know when it breaks.</p>

<a id="how-it-works"></a>
<div class="double-flex full-height">
  <section>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>Greenkeeper sits between npm and GitHub, observing all of the modules you depend on. When they get updated, your project gets a new branch with that update. Your CI tests kick in, and we watch them to see whether they pass.</p>
    <p>Based on the test results and your current version definitions we will open up clear, actionable pull requests or issues for you. If there‚Äôs nothing for you to do, we won‚Äôt nag you.</p>
    <p>Let the friendly Greenkeeper bot take all the dull work of keeping your dependencies up to date off your shoulders and, optimally, boil it all down to a few clicks. <strong>This is as close to fully automatic as we could possibly make it.</strong></p>
    <p><a href='/docs.html#what-greenkeeper-does'>Learn more about how Greenkeeper works</a>.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Why it‚Äôs so neat</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Staying on top of dependency updates is a lot of cognitive overhead: your code depends on modules that depend on modules. It‚Äôs modules all the way down. Stuff gets updated all the time. It‚Äôll either annoy you, or you‚Äôll miss it. <strong>Greenkeeper never misses updates, and it never gets annoyed</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Pin versions with one click:</strong> You‚Äôve got stuff to do, we understand. Sometimes you simply have to make a pragmatic trade-off between fixing your build for the breaking update or just pinning the working version so you can get back to it later. Our bot can respect that.</li>
      <li>You could do all the updates and testing by hand, all the time. But that‚Äôs dull, repetitive work, which is why, let‚Äôs be honest, barely anyone actually does it. But Greenkeeper <em>will</em> do it, day or night, without complaining, while requiring as little of your attention as possible.</li>
