    <h3>Catches problems you would have missed</h3>
    <p>Versioning isn‚Äôt perfect or reliable: you‚Äôd expect a patch update to a dependency, for example <code>1.0.1</code> to <code>1.0.2</code>, to be unproblematic, but unless you actually try it, you won‚Äôt know until it‚Äôs too late. <strong>We found that around 15% of all minor and patch updates break their dependent code</strong>, even though semantically they shouldn‚Äôt. Greenkeeper tests every single update for you, day or night, workday or weekend, so you don‚Äôt have to.</p>

<div class="double-flex full-height">
  <section>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>Greenkeeper sits between npm and GitHub, observing all of the modules you depend on. When they get updated, your project gets a new branch with that update. Your CI tests kick in, and we watch them to see whether they pass.</p>
    <p>Based on the test results and your current version definitions we will open up clear, actionable pull requests or issues for you. If there‚Äôs nothing for you to do, we won‚Äôt nag you.</p>
    <p>Let the friendly Greenkeeper bot take all the dull work of keeping your dependencies up to date off your shoulders and, optimally, boil it all down to a few clicks. <strong>This is as close to fully automatic as we could possibly make it.</strong></p>
    <p><a href='/docs.html#what-greenkeeper-does'>Learn more about how Greenkeeper works</a>.</p>
  </section>

    <h2>Why it‚Äôs so neat</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Staying on top of dependency updates is a lot of cognitive overhead: your code depends on modules that depend on modules. It‚Äôs modules all the way down. Stuff gets updated all the time. It‚Äôll either annoy you, or you‚Äôll miss it. <strong>Greenkeeper never misses updates, and it never gets annoyed</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Pin versions with one click:</strong> You‚Äôve got stuff to do, we understand. Sometimes you simply have to make a pragmatic trade-off between fixing your build for the breaking update or just pinning the working version so you can get back to it later. Our bot can respect that.</li>
      <li>You could do all the updates and testing by hand, all the time. But that‚Äôs dull, repetitive work, which is why, let‚Äôs be honest, barely anyone actually does it. But Greenkeeper <em>will</em> do it, day or night, without complaining, while requiring as little of your attention as possible.</li>
